# Stopwatch, Two digit counter in VHDL using seven segment (Nexys 2 FPGA / ModelSim)

This project cover many basic,yet interesting areas of FPGA design such as :
Display multiplexing for the multi-digit display,
Synchronous cascaded counter circuits to increment time registers for seconds and minutes, 
And a finite state machine to give us start, stop, and reset functionality.
